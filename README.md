# Show Angle and Distance
Glyphs app plugin that shows on the info panel the angle and distance between currently selected notes.
The angle and distance are simply calculated between the bottom left and top right corners of the selection rectangle. Upright is 0°, horizontal is 90°, and everything else falls in between (‘Italic angle’ kind of logic).
